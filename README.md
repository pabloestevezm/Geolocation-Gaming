# Geolocation-Gaming

In this project we are going to see, with the information from the datasets (link down)â€‹, where I would select the office to accomplish the most number of the objectives that you can see below:

- Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
- 30% of the company have at least 1 child.
- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.
- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not to far.
- Account managers need to travel a lot
- All people in the company have between 25 and 40 years, give them some place to go to party.
- The CEO is Vegan
- If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.
- The office dog "Pepe" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away.

To work on this project we did a cleaning of the companies.json file, to get the startups and the design companies throwing queries to mongodb.

When I could get the companies in the companies.json file that I wanted, I started working with a kaggle dataset with over 27k Starbucks shops around the world (later we see the filters and how I choose only 200 to the last part)

Finally, I decided to get New York because of the companies (startups and design) to have more information to do geoqueries. I could get San Francisco also because of the final filters could be perfect but I prefer to pick New York and our maintenance guy could see the Knicks instead of the Warriors.
